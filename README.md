Along with the times and advances in information system technology, goods delivery services carried out by the post office are now more systematic. The post office now not only delivers letters but also delivers parcels from senders destined for a certain city. In this case the courier must deliver a lot of goods to the customer's city with consideration of time efficiency.

Meanwhile, nowadays, the large number of roads sometimes makes it difficult for postal workers to be able to choose a fast route to the customer's destination. Usually the path taken is only a path that is memorized and often traveled and is considered the shortest, even though this path is not necessarily more optimal.

Therefore we need a system that utilizes information technology to automatically search for the optimum path. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is the problem of a salesman who wants to visit several places where he returns to his original place exactly once so that the shortest distance is obtained.
